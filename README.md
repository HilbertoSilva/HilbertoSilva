Hi Everyone!

Welcome to my Github repository (still, and always, under construction). Here I'll be posting the cool stuff I'll be doing.

I'm a Data Engineer at Philip Morris International. I did my BSc and my MSc in Astrophysics at the University of Porto. During my academic formation I had the opportunity to work and learn a little bit of some interesting programming languages such as Python and R. I also been dedicating some time to learn SQL.

In this repository you can find some small exercises I did while learning Python or SQL... Also some slightly larger projects that I took upon as learning exercises on my own.
Most of the things I work in I can't, for obvious reasons, share them here...

If you have any questions, or projects you find interesting, let me know. I'm always ready to learn and try something new!
You can reach me at hilberto.silva@gmail.com.
