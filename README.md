Hi Everyone!

Welcome to my Github repository (still, and always, under construction). Here I'll be posting the cool stuff I'll be doing.

I'm a PhD student of Astrophysics at the University of Lisbon. I did my BSc and my MSc at the University of Porto. During my academic formation I had the opportunity to work and learn a little bit of some interesting programming languages such as Python and R. I also been dedicating some time to learn SQL. My aim is to work as a Data Analyst or Scientist. I hope you enjoy this page. 
If you have any questions, or projects you find interesting, let me know. I'm always ready to learn and try something new!
You can reach me at hilberto.silva@gmail.com.
